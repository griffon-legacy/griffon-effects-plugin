Apply animation effects to components and windows. Inspired by [script.aculo.us][1] effects.

Usage
-----

Effects can be applied in two ways:

 *  create a new Effect instance and run it.
 *  use the convenience methods exposed by `griffon.effects.Effects` (each method matches the effect's name in lower case,
 Move =&gt; Effects.move)

Every effect takes the following parameters:

 * `component` - the component to be animated
 * `params` - a map with effect options, may be empty or null
 * `callback` - a closure to be called at the end of the effect, optional.

All effects share the following options unless otherwise specified:

 * `duration` - ong, how long should the animation take. default: 500l
 * `delay` - long, wait time before the animation starts. default: 0l
 * `ease`Â - TimelineEase. default: Linear
 * `wait` - boolean. Forces the current thread to wait until the effect has finished running default: false

Make sure the calling thread is not the UI thread when setting `wait:` to true

Some effects accept an `anchor` option, whose value is defined by the `griffon.effects.Anchor` enum. Additional valid values
are string literals in lower case, with underscores substituted by spaces; literals from SwingConstants are also valid. Examples

 *  Anchor.TOP == 'top' == 'TOP' == 'NORTH' == 'north
 *  Anchor.TOP_LEFT == 'top left == 'top_left' == 'NORTH EAST' == 'north east'

### Basic Effects

#### Move

Animates the `location` property of the target component
Parameters:

 * `x` - int, in pixels. default: 0i
 * `y` - int, in pixels. default: 0i
 * `mode` - String, if movement should be 'relative' or 'absolute'. default: 'relative'

#### Resize

Animates the `size` property of the target component
Parameters:

 * `w` - int, in pixels. default: 0i
 * `h` - int, in pixels. default: 0
 * `mode` - String, if the update should be 'relative' or 'absolute'. default: 'relative'

#### Bounds

Animates the `bounds` property of a the target component
Parameters:

 * `x` - int, in pixels. default: 0i
 * `y` - int, in pixels. default: 0i
 * `w` - int, in pixels. default: 0i
 * `h` - int, in pixels. default: 0
 * `mode` - String, if the update should be 'relative' or 'absolute'. default: 'relative'

#### Scale

Animates the `bounds` property of the target component by calculating a scale factor
Parameters:

 * `scaleX` - boolean, if the x coorinate should scale. default: true
 * `scaleY` - boolean, if the y coorinate should scale. default: true
 * `from` - float, starting value in percentage. default: 100.0f
 * `to` - float, ending value in percentage. default: 0.0f
 * `anchor` - Anchor, anchoring point. default: Anchor.CENTER

#### Opacity

Animates a window's `opacity` property
Parameters:

 * `from` - float, starting value. default: 0.0f
 * `to` - float, ending value. default: 1.0f

#### Fade

Animates a window's `opacity` from its current value or 1.0f to 0.0f

#### Appear

Animates a window's `opacity` from its current value or 0.0f to 1.0f

### Composite Effects

#### Shake

Moves a component from right to left a few times
Parameters:

 * `distance` - int, in pixels. default: 20i

#### Puff

Fades and blows up a window

#### DropOut

Fades and moves a window out of the screen
Paremeters:

 * `anchor` - Anchor, anchoring point. default: Anchor.BOTTOM

#### DropIn

Appears and moves a window to the center of the screen
Paremeters:

 * `anchor` - Anchor, anchoring point. default: Anchor.TOP

### Chained events

Effects can be chained in a sequential manner by using the `chain(List&lt;Effect&gt;)` method provided by `griffon.effects.Effects`
utility class.
